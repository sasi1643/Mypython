Howdy, Welcome to my Page! My name is Sasi kanth Paruchuri and I am from India. I am a passionate data analyst who is hungry for all the latest happenings going on in the data science field.

I believe in constantly improving my skills and keeping myself abreast with current knowledge in the field of data science. This curiosity led me to pursue edX Data Science Specialization and Udacity's Data Analyst Nano-Degree. I want to pursue a career in data science where I can apply my math and stat knowledge, computational and programming skills.
